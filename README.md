# Duster
Duster is an app that lets you collect your own data from a treadmill and track progress through time.  
This repository holds the rails app that receives and displays data. 
There is a hardware component that's in charge of collecting the data from the treadmill and sending it to this rails app.  See [here](http://github.com/kardasis/duster)
